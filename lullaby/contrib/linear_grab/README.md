# `LinearGrabSystem`


Allows entities to be grabbed and moved by the controller along a line.

The line can be defined in either world space or the local space of the
grabbed entity. The line direction is specified in the entity's blueprint,
and the origin of the line is defined at runtime as the point where the
entity is grabbed.
